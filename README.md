# Radix-Sort
 This radix program sorts strings with a maximum length of 15.  Randomly generates 10,000 strings with lengths from 1 to 15 (during the sort and with strings less than 15, treats all positions at the end that are not there as space). When generating random characters for the string, the following weights are applied: 10% be digits 10% special characters 80% alphabetic characters  Before the sort, prints out the first 10 strings, prints out the middle 10 strings, and print last 10 strings. Then does the radix sort which main then prints out the first 10 strings, the middle 10 strings, and last 10 strings.
